# Exploratory Data Analysis datasets

This repository will contain datasets, both tidy and untidy, useful in Exploratory Data Analysis.


| Name | Status | Source | Description |
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:-----------|
| `ca_immigrants.csv` | processed | American Community Survey, <br> Census <br> (IPUMS) | This dataset contains 4 variables: <br> `year` of survey  , <br> birthplace (`bpld`), <br> educational attainment (`agg educd`), <br> and number of people (`perwt`). |




If the dataset contains less than 5 variables please list them on the description. Otherwise be as detailed as possible while still being succint. 

Always include a **source**

For status there are three options: 
* **tidy** - the dataset is clean and in tidy-form)
* **un-tidy** - the dataset requires processing before further exploration
* **processed** - the dataset has had some processing and can be explored as is but is not in perfect tidy format (it could use some more processing -  these are great for beginners to practice data-cleaning on top of data-exploration techniques!)
